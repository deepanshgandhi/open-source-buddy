        Rank GitHub issues based on skill profile match using a two-phase optimization approach.
        
        OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:
        =====================
        This method uses a two-phase approach for maximum efficiency:
        
        Phase 1 (Fast): Calculate similarity scores for ALL issues
        - Only does cosine similarity computation (local, fast)
        - No expensive API calls (OpenAI, GitHub)
        - Processes N issues to get top K by similarity
        
        Phase 2 (Expensive): Enrich only top K issues
        - Issue analysis via OpenAI API (K calls instead of N)
        - Repository summaries via GitHub + OpenAI APIs (unique repos only)
        - Batch processing to handle duplicate repositories efficiently
        
        PERFORMANCE BENEFITS:
        ====================
        - Before: N × (similarity + analysis + repo_summary) → O(N) expensive operations
        - After: N × similarity + K × analysis + unique_repos × repo_summary → O(K) expensive operations
        - Typical improvement: 10x-100x faster when K << N
        - Cost reduction: ~90% fewer API calls in typical scenarios
